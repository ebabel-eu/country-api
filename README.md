# Workshop for NodeJS CRUD operations on an entity with a RESTful web API

## Introduction

### What are we building?

We are going to build a NodeJS web API that runs CRUD operations on a single entity: a globalized list of countries.

### How do we work?

We run this workshop in a https://www.nitrous.io/ virtual machine, to quickly get up to speed with our development environment.

Git is used to checkout each step of building our web API together.

The starting point is an almost empty "master" branch.

The final result we are aiming for is in the "final-solution" branch.

Your code is to be commited in your local repository but not pushed to the remote repository.

### Why is this project interesting?

When DEV is not ready to deliver a web API, you can quickly make one for your development environment.

If we build a custom web app that doesn't use a CMS and relies on a thick front-end UI, you are free to develop your own web services API.


## Installation

Create a NodeJS virtual machine on https://www.nitrous.io/

In Chrome, install the Advanced Rest Client app: chrome-extension://hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo/RestClient.html

Open a console command line on the Nitrous virtual machine

Change your directory to ~/worspace

  git clone https://github.com/ebabel-eu/country-api.git
